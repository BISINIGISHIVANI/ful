Doja Marketing/Defi Founder
"These web technologies quickly became a game-changer for our business. Lead generation projects that used to take a whole team are completely automatic now. We were able to segment traffic based on location, identify more prospects, and onboard more clients. I can't say enough good things about Ful.io."

"Companies need an edge, and Ful.io provided that edge for us. We'd previously used BuiltWith, but the data and analytics capabilities of Ful.io were a better fit for us."

"Ful.io's apps and tools have completely changed the way we look at traffic and identify prospects. Before, our R&D team tried BuiltWith, then worked to develop our own technology. But with Ful.io, we can save both time and money."

Yana L
SEO Consultant
"Any ecommerce platform not using Ful.io's technologies is seriously missing out. The crawling tool at Ful.io is the best we've used so far. We love that you can pull it up right in the Chrome browser too. Location, contact info, RSS, the speed we can draw in new clients now... Ful.io is amazing."
